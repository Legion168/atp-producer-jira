# ATP Producer - Jira Throughput & Cycle Time Analysis Tool

## üìã Overview

ATP Producer is a Python-based web application that analyzes team performance by calculating **ATP (Average Throughput Performance)** metrics from Jira data. The tool provides comprehensive insights into team productivity, cycle times, and work completion patterns across different time periods.

## üéØ Purpose

As a Team Leader, you can use this tool to:
- **Track Team Performance**: Monitor throughput and cycle time improvements
- **Set Goals**: Establish targets like "Improve throughput by 20%"
- **Measure Impact**: Quantify the effect of process improvements (e.g., adopting Cursor for pair-programming/AI boost)
- **Quarterly Analysis**: Compare performance across different quarters
- **Identify Trends**: Spot patterns in team productivity over time

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Backend**: Python with Jira REST API integration
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy for calculations
- **Authentication**: Jira API tokens

### Key Components
- `app/main.py`: Main Streamlit application and UI
- `app/jira_client.py`: Jira API client and data fetching
- `app/metrics.py`: ATP calculation logic and metrics
- `app/config.py`: Configuration management

## üìä ATP Calculation Rules

### Definition
**ATP (Average Throughput Performance)** is calculated using two primary metrics:

1. **Throughput**: Total number of tasks, stories, or bugs transitioned to "Done" status within a specific time interval
2. **Cycle Time**: Total time elapsed from when work starts on an issue (first transition to "In Progress") until it is marked as "Done"

### Throughput Calculation

#### What Counts as "Completed"
- Issues with **resolution** set to any valid value (not "Won't Do" or "None")
- Issues that were **closed** within the specified time window
- Only issues assigned to the selected person (if specified)

#### What's Excluded
- Issues with resolution "Won't Do" (unless set by the same person being analyzed)
- Issues with incomplete status transition data
- Issues without valid "In Progress" start dates
- Subtasks (when "Include subtasks in ATP calculation" checkbox is unchecked)

### Cycle Time Calculation

The application provides **two complementary cycle time metrics**:

#### 1. Active Cycle Time (Team Performance)
- **Definition**: Active work time excluding waiting states and impediment periods
- **Excludes**: Time in Acceptance, Feedback, and impediment periods
- **Use for**: Team velocity measurement, process improvement
- **Formula**: `(total_seconds - excluded_seconds - impediment_seconds) / 86400` days

#### 2. Impediment Time (Blocking Analysis)
- **Definition**: Time spent flagged as "Impediment"
- **Tracks**: "Flagged" field changes in Jira changelog
- **Use for**: Identifying systemic bottlenecks, process optimization
- **Formula**: `impediment_seconds / 86400` days

#### Start of Work ("In Progress")
The cycle time starts when an issue transitions to any of the configured "In Progress" statuses:
- **Default**: "In Development", "Failed/Blocked", "Analysis"
- **Configurable**: Can be customized in the UI

#### End of Work ("Done")
The cycle time ends when an issue is marked as completed:
- **Resolution-based**: When resolution is set to a valid value
- **Status-based**: When status changes to "Closed" (configurable)

#### Special Rules & Edge Cases

##### 1. Assignee-Specific Filtering
- **"In Progress" Start**: Only transitions by the target assignee count as work start
- **"Done" End**: Any valid completion by anyone counts (handles work handoffs)

##### 2. Automation Handling
- If automation moves an issue to "In Progress" and the target person takes action within 1 hour, the automation time is used as the start
- This accounts for automated workflows followed by human intervention

##### 3. "Pick Up and Put Back" Detection
- If a person moves an issue to "In Progress" and immediately moves it back to "Backlog" within 1 hour, this doesn't count as work start
- Prevents false cycle time calculations from brief status changes

##### 4. Multiple Work Periods
- For issues that are reopened and retaken, cycle time is calculated from the **most recent** "In Progress" transition that led to the **final** completion
- This ensures cycle time reflects the actual work period, not the total time including gaps

##### 5. "Won't Do" Resolution Handling
- If someone **other than** the target assignee sets resolution to "Won't Do", this completion is ignored
- If the **target assignee** sets resolution to "Won't Do", it still counts as their completion
- This handles external cancellations vs. self-cancellations appropriately

##### 6. Subtask Filtering
- **Default Behavior**: All issue types (including subtasks) are included in ATP calculations
- **Filtering Option**: Use the "Include subtasks in ATP calculation" checkbox to exclude subtasks
- **When Unchecked**: JQL queries automatically exclude issues with `issuetype = Sub-task`
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Exclude subtasks when you want to focus on main work items (stories, tasks, bugs)
  - Include subtasks when you want comprehensive throughput metrics including granular work breakdown
- **Impact**: Affects both throughput counts and cycle time calculations

##### 7. Resolution Clearing
- When resolution is cleared (set to "None"), this doesn't count as completion
- Only non-empty, non-"None" resolutions are considered valid completions

##### 8. Assignee Changes to "In Progress" Issues
- When a person gets assigned to an issue that is already in "In Progress" status, the assignment time counts as the start of work
- This handles scenarios where work is handed off or reassigned mid-process
- Example: Issue is in "In Development" status, then person A gets assigned ‚Üí assignment time becomes the "In Progress" start for person A

##### 9. "In Progress" Date Overwrite Rules
- **Backlog Overwrite**: When a person moves an issue from "Backlog" to any "In Progress" status, this overwrites any previous "In Progress" date
- **No Other Overwrites**: Transitions from other statuses (like "Feedback", "To Do", "Analysis") to "In Progress" do NOT overwrite the original date
- **Purpose**: Ensures that only significant work starts (from Backlog) reset the cycle time, while minor status changes preserve the original work start
- **Examples**:
  - ‚úÖ "Backlog" ‚Üí "In Development": **OVERWRITES** previous "In Progress" date
  - ‚ùå "Feedback" ‚Üí "In Development": **PRESERVES** original "In Progress" date
  - ‚ùå "Analysis" ‚Üí "In Development": **PRESERVES** original "In Progress" date
